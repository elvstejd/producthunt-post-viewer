# ProductHunt Post Viewer

</div>

I like browsing Product Hunt either for inspiration or to find cool new software I can use. This tool allows me to view products faster by tinder-like swiping on them.

## To-Do

- [ ] Connect to Product Hunt API
- [x] Save liked posts to local storage
- [ ] Show liked posts
- [ ] Use keyboard (arrow keys, spacebar) to interact with current visible post

## Run Locally

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/elvstejd/producthunt-post-viewer.git
  cd producthunt-post-viewer
```

```bash
  yarn install
```

```bash
  yarn start
```
